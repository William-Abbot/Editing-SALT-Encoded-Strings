# Editing-SALT-Encoded-Strings
A tool used to add workers to SALT (Save And Load Tool) encoded strings for the Starcraft 2 custom game of the same name. The reason for creating this project was to remedy a problem which arose when I went to the website https://lotv.spawningtool.com (which contains many popular build orders that people practice with) and tried to import one of the build orders there into the SALT custom game only to learn that the spawningtool website did not include worker units in the encoded string which is used to import the build order.



The SALT custom game is used to help practice build orders without having to leave, make a new lobby for, and play an entirely new game.
